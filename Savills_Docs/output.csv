C. Environmental Considerations,,,
"EnergyConsumptionReduction","The Décret Tertiaire is a legal text outlining essential measures for reducing energy consumption in tertiary sectorbuildings. The objective of the Décret Tertiaire is to reduce energy consumption in three stages:-- A 40% reduction by 2030;- A further 50% reduction by 2040;- A final 60% reduction by 2050.This Decree specifically relates to buildings that fall into one of the following three categories:-- Tertiary activities located within a building with an area equal to or greater than 1,000 m2;- Tertiary sector building with an area equal to or greater than 1,000 m2;- Tertiary sector buildings of less than 1,000 m2 located on a single site, with a total combined area equal to orgreater than 1,000 m2.","The owner of the hotel should have declared the energy consumption reference year on the OPERAT platform before 30 September 2022 (being 12consecutive months of energy consumption between 2010 to 2019 when the hotel was in occupation), although a tolerance has been given until 31December 2022. The annual consumption for 2020 and 2021 should have also been declared on the OPERAT platform before 30 September 2022.We have not been provided with the Energy Performance Certificate or the Declaration issued through the Operat Platform. The cost would need to becovered by the current owner. Typical solutions that will help reduce energy consumption and contribute to reaching the objective set by the DécretTertiaire include reducing temperature of hot water, implementing a BMS system for the HVAC and lighting (to comply with BACS regulation, implementingfans coupled with the AC units (if free cooling is not available), implementing a complete metering strategy for power, heating, cooling and water,implementing an Energy Management System coupled with the BMS and adding or improving thermal wall and roof insulation.Specialist environmental engineers will need to be appointed by the Owner in order to conduct a more detailed and precise Décret Tertiaire assessment.",
